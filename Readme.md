Here’s a professional and GitHub-ready README.md file for your project, now updated to include the new section for Anomaly Detection using LSTM Autoencoders in Keras.

📄 README.md — Sales Forecasting & Anomaly Detection

# 🛍️ Sales Forecasting & Anomaly Detection with ARIMA, LSTM & Autoencoders

This project performs time series analysis and forecasting on retail sales data using ARIMA and LSTM models. It also includes anomaly detection using LSTM-based Autoencoders, all integrated with an SQLite database backend.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* SQLite (via sqlite3)
* pandas, numpy, matplotlib
* scikit-learn (preprocessing, metrics)
* TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM, Autoencoder)
* statsmodels (ARIMA)

## 📊 Features

### 1. Sales Forecasting

* Forecasts daily sales for a product using:

  * ARIMA model (from statsmodels)
  * LSTM (via Keras with hyperparameter tuning)
* Models compared using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Forecast plots overlaid with actual values

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning (LSTM)

* Tuned over combinations of:

  * Sequence Length
  * Number of LSTM Units
  * Training Epochs
* Selects the best model based on test MSE

### 3. Anomaly Detection (NEW!)

* Uses LSTM Autoencoder to learn sales data reconstruction
* High reconstruction error indicates potential anomalies
* Useful for spotting sudden spikes/drops in sales patterns

---

## 🗄️ Data Storage

* Sales data is stored in a local SQLite database: sales\_data.db
* You can easily replace this with your own sales dataset by updating the database table.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow statsmodels
```

2. Open the notebook:

* In Jupyter: open Sales\_Forecasting\_ARIMA\_vs\_LSTM\_Hyperparam.ipynb
* Or upload to Google Colab

3. Run all cells:

* Includes data loading, ARIMA and LSTM forecasting, tuning, and anomaly detection

---

## 🧠 Anomaly Detection: How It Works

* The LSTM Autoencoder is trained to reconstruct normal sales patterns.
* Anomalies are detected when the reconstruction error exceeds a defined threshold.
* Results are visualized with anomalies highlighted on a line plot.

Example Output:

* ✅ Normal days: low reconstruction error
* ❌ Anomalies: sudden peaks or drops not seen during training

---

## 📈 Sample Output

* Forecast comparison plot (ARIMA vs LSTM)
* Anomaly detection plot with flagged outliers

---

## ✅ To Do (Optional Enhancements)

* Add SARIMA or Prophet for advanced time series modeling
* Build a Streamlit or Dash dashboard for interactive use
* Save and deploy trained models for real-time prediction
